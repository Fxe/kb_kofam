    <p>KofamScan assigns KEGG KO identifiers to the user's genome protein CDS by HMMER/HMMSEARCH against KOfam (a customized HMM database of KEGG Orthologs (KOs)). </p>
    <p>KO number assignments with scores above the predefined thresholds for individual KOs are more reliable than other proposed assignments. </p>
